We report on a design of a computationally efficient parallelized framework to analyze the large data volume generated by our muon tomography detector system. The detector system consists of plastic scintillator counters with photomultiplier tubes and a CAMAC data acquisition system with analog-to-digital (ADC), time-to-digital (TDC), and scaler modules. We share our preliminary results that make use of reduced TDC information based on a novel "time - conservation" approach and introduce methods for generating tomograms through such schema. Further, we discuss applications of machine-learning inspired techniques for generating high fidelity images by maximizing dataset utility. The sequential emission file generated by the telescope makes it an ideal candidate for training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) which would recast the problem of predicting ”next hits” as an optimization problem. Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) networks to contextualize the entire data frame are also utilized which provide an additional constraint on the training policy for the RNNs making the regime even more robust. Image Segmentation (IS) is finally used to generate a pixel map that extracts shape information of target object which constitutes the final constraint layer for the RNN training routine.
